Warning: *Currently works only on Android, this application uses a custom-made plugin, which makes use of platform channels. Platform channels are means for you to call native platform code (Java -> Android | Objective-C/Swift -> iOS) and integrate them with Flutter. I have made and tested this plugin only in Java, in other words, on Android. Key functionalities rely on the platform channel, such as audio capturing from the microphone*

# Flutter Guitar Tuner

My first (and currently only) Flutter project.

When I started this project, I had just recently bought my first guitar.

About a week into learning about music theory and the guitar itself, I was looking for some apps that could perhaps help me in the learning process, specifically an application that had what, in my eyes, I needed at the time.

Not that it was really necessary, but there were a couple of things I wanted that I couldn't find in a single app, even though I could find "parts" of what I wanted in some of the apps.

Since it had been a while from the last time I had a personal project, I thought, why not now, right?

The plan was basically to have an application that, as I said, has things I find useful and could help me in the learning process. For this, the app should have one fundamental piece, which is the "tuner".

Even though many apps have tuners, I felt like there were some things I liked and disliked about some apps.
If I made my own app, I could implement "the best" of both worlds, without the need to, perhaps, go to another app just to make use of one functionality, then go back to another one... It would be much more handy to just have them in one single app, and it would save some storage space as well.

I took that as an opportunity to program my first mobile application, specifically an android application at the moment, and learn Flutter/Dart in the process, which is something I have had my eyes in for a couple of months.
